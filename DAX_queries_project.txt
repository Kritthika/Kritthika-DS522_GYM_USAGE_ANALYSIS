1. Create a Season Column
Season = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    Table[month] IN {12, 1, 2}, "Winter",
    Table[month] IN {3, 4, 5}, "Spring",
    Table[month] IN {6, 7, 8}, "Summer",
    "Fall"
)

2. Calculate Weekend_Visits
Weekend_Visits = Table[is_weekend] * Table[number_people]

3. Average Attendance by Season
Avg_Attendance_By_Season = 
AVERAGEX(
    FILTER(
        Table,
        Table[season] = SELECTEDVALUE(Table[season])
    ),
    Table[number_people]
)


4. Total Weekend vs. Weekday Attendance
Total_Weekend_Attendance = 
SUMX(
    FILTER(
        Table,
        Table[is_weekend] = 1
    ),
    Table[number_people]
)

Total_Weekday_Attendance = 
SUMX(
    FILTER(
        Table,
        Table[is_weekend] = 0
    ),
    Table[number_people]
)


5. Holiday Attendance
Total_Holiday_Attendance = 
SUMX(
    FILTER(
        Table,
        Table[is_holiday] = 1
    ),
    Table[number_people]
)
